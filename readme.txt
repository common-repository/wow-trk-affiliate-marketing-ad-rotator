WOW TRK lets you easily make money from your site. Quickly & easily show banner ads on your site, which automatically optimise and geo-target.

== Description ==

Start earning money from your website today with the WOW TRK affiliate network! This lightweight plugin easily lets you add banner rotators on your site, automatically above or below posts or as a widget on your site. The banner ads automatically rotate and optimise to show the best performing banners. Banner Ads also geo target so for example a user in the UK will see a banner for an offer that allows UK traffic.

You can choose the size of the banner rotator from a list of predefined sizes. Ads are from the WOW TRK network so you must be signed up to WOW TRK to use the plugin.

You can register for an affiliate account for free here: https://www.wowtrk.com/signup-affiliate/

WOW TRK has over 200 offers and pays out per conversion. So for example an offer might pay per registration to their website, competition entry or when a user makes a deposit on a gambling website, these are all examples of conversions. Conversion payouts vary from low values of around £1 all the way up to £200+ depending on the type of offer. Payments can be sent to you via PayPal and Local Bank Transfer in 20+ Countries.

Reporting on your WOW TRK account is in real-time, so you can easily see straight away how much you are making from the traffic you have delivered.

== Changelog ==

1.4 - Changed the plugin so that for new installs HTTPS links are enabled by default. It is highly recommended all users of the plugin enable HTTPS links due to Chrome changes. You can now display a 300x250 Ad with the WOW TRK Widget. Ads inserted now have a CSS class so you can easily target them with CSS. Some parts of the plugin have been reworded to make them clearer. No longer including the WOW TRK logo to make the plugin even more light-weight (its now less than 25KB in size!). Tested to be compatible with Wordpress up to 5.3.2.

1.3.2 - Bug fixes.

1.3.1 - Changed references to brand new to style correctly, removed references to instant account approval as applications are now reviewed manually. Also tested with the latest version of Wordpress (5.1.1).
